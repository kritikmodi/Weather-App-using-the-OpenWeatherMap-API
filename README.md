# Weather-App-using-the-OpenWeatherMap-API
This application uses the OpenWeatherMap API from openweathermap.org to fetch the weather data of the entered city in JSON format. Several methods are implemented to extract and display the temperature, humidity and pressure data of the city using the Volley library. The entire project is done in Android Studio.
